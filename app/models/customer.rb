    # The funstion below migrates attachement to dropbox: it follows the following steps:
    # 1. Connect to the Rocket Elevators DropBox account
    # 2. Create a directory in DropBox on behalf of the client if the client does not already exist
    # 3. Extract the file stored in the binary field of the MySQL database
    # 4. Copy this file to the client DropBox directory
    # 5. If the document is successfully downloaded to Dropbox, the controller deletes the content of the binary field from the database to avoid duplication
